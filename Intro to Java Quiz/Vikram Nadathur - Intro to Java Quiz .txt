Intro to Java Quiz______________________________________________________________
DIRECTIONS: Answer each question in RED. You may not use the internet (except for this document) or any other programs for the quiz.


1) What is this code for? public static void main(String [] args)
This code is for creating the main method.
2) List 2 reference types. What is one thing you know about reference types that is not true about primitives types?
String and Scanner are two reference types. One difference between a reference and a primitive type is that primitive types do not contain methods which can be called upon.
3) List 3 primitive types. What is one thing you know about primitive types that is not true about reference types?
char, int, double. Primitive types start with a lowercase letter.
4) Print your name on the screen on one line. 
System.out.println(“Vikram Nadathur”);
5) Print your first and last name on separate lines. 
System.out.print(“Vikram\nNadathur ”);
6) Write code to ask the user to enter an int. Print out the square root of that int.


Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);


System.out.println(“Enter a integer”);
Int num = sc.nextInt();
System.out.println(“\n The square root of ” + num + “ is” + sqrt(num) + “.” )
7) All of these parts are in the same program. 


a) Create ints a and b with the values 3 and 5, and doubles x and y with the values 2.5
and 5.1
int a = 3;
int b = 5 ;
        double x = 2.5;
        double y = 5.1;
b) Using a and b print: A = 3, B = 5.                                                                                                                                                                    Cvn                                                                                                                                                                                      bv vcvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvncvvvvvvvvvbnccccccccccccccccbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnbnncvbncccccccvbncvnvvbvbbbvvvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbvbccccvvvvvvvvv
System.out.println(“A = ” + a + ” B = ” + b);
c) Using a and b print: A + B = 8
System.out.println(“A + B = ” + (a+b);
d) Using a and b print: A + B = 35
System.out.println(“A + B = ” + a + b);
What is printed as a result of 


11) System.out.print(a * y);
15[a][b]
12) System.out.print(b / a);1


13) System.out.print("x - y = " + x - y);
ERROR
14) System.out.print("x + y = " + x + y);
“x + y = 2.55.1”[c]
15) Write code that prints out the even integers between 0 and 20 on the same line.
for(int i=0; i<21; i++){
        if(i%2==0)
                System.out.println(i);
}
16) Write code that asks the user to enter numbers until they enter a negative number or a number larger than 100.
Scanner sc =new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.println(“Please enter a number”);
int Num = sc.nextInt();
while(Num<100){
        System.out.println(“Your number is less than 100”);
        System.out.println(“Please enter a number”);
int Num = sc.nextInt();
}
while(Num>0){
[d]


        System.out.println(“Your number is positive”);
        System.out.println(“Please enter a number”);
int Num = sc.nextInt();
}


17) What is the result of the following method calls?


        a) "Ritisha".substring(2)        “tisha”
        
        b) "G-Money".length();7
                
        c) “Joheen”.substring(2, 3);”h”
                
        d) “Hello World”.substring(3, 7);”lo W”
        
        e) “Apple”.compareTo(“Banana”); A negative number
        
        f) “Hello”.equals(“World”); False
        
18) Write the code to produce the following result. Only use these variables, do not write anything in quotes.


        String w1 = “Hello”;
        String w2 = “World”;


        a) llo
        System.out.println(w1.substring(2));
        b) Worl
                System.out.println(w2.substring(0,4));
        c) true
                System.out.println(w1.equals(w1));
d) false        
System.out.println(w1.equals(w2));
        e) 0        
System.out.println(w1.indexOf(w2)+1);


19) Write me some code that asks the user to enter two ints. Print out the geometric mean of the numbers. 
The geometric mean of a and b is x if   




Scanner sc =  new Scanner(System.in);


System.out.println(“Enter the first number”);
int a = sc.nextInt();
System.out.println(“Enter the second number”);
int b = sc.nextInt();
int geomean = sqrt(a*b);
System.out.println(“The geometric mean of the two number is ” + geomean);




[a]15.3
[b]-1
[c]good
[d]should be one loop
-2
